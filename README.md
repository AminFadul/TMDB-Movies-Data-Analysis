# Udacity--Project-Investigate-TMDB-Movies-Dataset

## Project Overview
In this project, we have to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it.
We will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

### Why this Project?
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! 

### Questions to answer?

* Average revenue for Action movies
* Top 10 movies in 2011
* Movie directors with the longest average runtime

### Dataset

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

Variables:
- id
- imdb_id
- popularity
- budget
- revenue
- original_title
- cast
- homepage
- director
- tagline	
- keywords
- overview
- runtime
- genres
- production_companies
- release_date
- vote_count
- vote_average
- release_year
- budget_adj
- revenue_adj

# Files
- tmdb-movies.csv
- tmdb_movies_cleaned.csv [output of the project]

### Outcome

* Analyze any given data-set
* Clean given data from any noisy data
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
